    abstract = { The widespread availability and use of E-Cigarettes in many countries has established the need for an assessment of their effect on children. By the end of 2017 the number published annually on E-Cigarettes had increased to 2976 and included 171 papers on E-Cigarettes and children. The objective of this commentary is to provide a review and public health perspective on the effects of E-cigarettes on children. There are four public health questions to be answered:1. Are E-Cigarettes and replenishing fluids toxic on accidental ingestion?2. If children smoke E-Cigarettes is this harmful?3. Does exposure to second hand vapour from E-Cigarettes cause harm to children?4. Are children (adolescents) who use E Cigarettes more likely to begin smoking conventional cigarettes?There were 2229 reported exposures to e-cigarette fluids and liquid nicotine in the USA in 2017 causing cardiovascular symptoms of varying severity. No deaths were reported although the potential is always there. Exposure to E-Cigarette vapor is less dangerous than cigarette smoke. However it does damage pulmonary endothelium in experimental models. No long term studies are yet available on chronic diseases although vapor does contain carcinogens. Adolescents who use E-Cigarettes are more likely to become tobacco smokers. Because of the accumulating evidence of harm to children great caution should be exercised in widening the public promotion and usage of E-Cigarettes. Children should avoid any contact with E-cigarettes or their vapour. }

	abstract = {Background The complex cigarette tax system in Indonesia has created the opportunity for cigarette producers to avoid tax, which results in affordable cigarette prices. In addition to increasing cigarette tax every year, the government has adopted several policies to increase cigarette prices, such as reducing the number of tiers and applying cigarette tax based on the combined production of affiliated companies (ie, firms with a minimum 10\% ownership of another cigarette company, sharing the same boards of commissioners or using input from other tobacco companies, in which a firm has at least 10\% ownership).Objective To investigate the effect of cigarette tax, affiliated company rules and changes in the number of tiers on cigarette prices produced in Indonesia.Method Using brand level data from 2005 to 2017, we model cigarette prices as a function of cigarette tax, affiliated company rules, number of tiers, cigarette types and cigarette tax system using random effect and fixed effect estimations.Finding We find that a percentage increase in cigarette tax increases cigarette prices by less than 1\% for all cigarette types. The implementation of affiliated company rules is effective in increasing cigarette prices for both affiliated and non-affiliated firms. We also find that a fewer number of tiers are associated with a higher cigarette price. Our results suggest that a reduction in the number of tiers will increase the effectiveness of a specific tax system in making cigarettes less affordable.},

To examine the impact of cigarette price and smoking environment on allocation of household expenditure and its implication on nutrition consumption.

Design

A cross-sectional study was conducted using the 2014 National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), the 2014 Village Potential Survey (PODES) and the 2013 Basic National Health Survey (RISKESDAS). SUSENAS and PODES data were collected by the Central Bureau of Statistics. RISKESDAS was conducted by National Institute of Health Research and Development (Balitbangkes), Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH).

Setting and participants

The sample covered all districts in Indonesia; with sample size of 285 400 households. These households are grouped into low, medium and high smoking prevalence districts.

Primary and secondary outcome measures

The impact of cigarette price and smoking environment on household consumption of cigarette, share of eight food groups, as well as calorie and protein intake.

Result

1% increase in cigarette price will increase the cigarette budget share by 0.0737 points and reduce the budget share for eggs/milk, prepared food, staple food, nuts, fish/meat and fruit, from 0.0200 points (eggs/milk) up to 0.0033 points (fruit). Reallocation of household expenditure brings changes in food composition, resulting in declining calorie and protein intake. A 1% cigarette price increase reduces calorie and protein intake as much as 0.0885% and 0.1052%, respectively. On the other hand, existence of smoke-free areas and low smoking prevalence areas reduces the household budget for cigarettes.

Conclusion

A pricing policy must be accompanied by non-pricing policies to reduce cigarette budget share.;},

   abstract = {Background: Indonesia is one of the largest consumers of tobacco in the world, however there has been little work done on the economics addiction of tobacco. This study provides an empirical test of a rational addiction (henceforth RA) hypothesis of cigarette demand in Indonesia. Methods: Four estimators (OLS, 2SLS, GMM, and System-GMM) were explored to test the RA hypothesis. The author adopted several diagnostics tests to select the best estimator to overcome econometric problems faced in presence of the past and future cigarette consumption (suspected endogenous variables). A short-run and long-run price elasticities of cigarettes demand was then calculated. The model was applied to individuals pooled data derived from three-waves a panel of the Indonesian Family Life Survey spanning the period 1993-2000. Results: The past cigarette consumption coefficients turned out to be a positive with a p -value < 1%, implying that cigarettes indeed an addictive goods. The rational addiction hypothesis was rejected in favour of myopic ones. The short-run cigarette price elasticity for male and female was estimated to be-0.38 and -0.57, respectively, and the long-run one was -0.4 and -3.85, respectively. Conclusions: Health policymakers should redesign current public health campaign against cigarette smoking in the country. Given the demand for cigarettes to be more prices sensitive for the long run (and female) than the short run (and male), an increase in the price of cigarettes could lead to a significant fall in cigarette consumption in the long run rather than as a constant source of government revenue.},
